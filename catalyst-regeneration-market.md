<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Catalyst Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-site Regeneration</li><li>On-site Regeneration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Catalyst regeneration involves the cleaning and restoration of catalysts used in industrial processes. The market is divided into two primary types: off-site regeneration and on-site regeneration. Off-site regeneration occurs at specialized facilities where spent catalysts are transported, cleaned, and treated, allowing for comprehensive processing and recovery. In contrast, on-site regeneration takes place directly at the industrial facility, minimizing downtime and transportation costs, while enabling immediate reuse of catalysts. Both methods aim to enhance efficiency and sustainability in catalytic processes.</p></p>
